# V0 analyzer ntuplizer

This ntuplizer fragment is copied here only for reference;
it cannot be built or run outside of the ntuplizer framework
(https://github.com/GhentAnalysis/heavyNeutrino).

Update: now the whole ntuplizer has been copied here for better reference;
but some folders containing data files have been removed here
to keep the size in check. The removed folders are:
- `heavyNeutrino/multilep/data`
- `heavyNeutrino/multilep/test/testing`
They can be downloaded from the repository if needed.

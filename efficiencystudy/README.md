# Absolute vertexing efficiency study

Note: this has not been seriously pursued so far,
perhaps extend later but for now this folder can be considered basically empty.

The goal is to study not only the data-to-simulation agreement for displaced vertexing,
but also the absolute efficiency.
This requires either the MC-truth level K-short mesons and their decay products,
or another kind of theory prediction for their decay spectrum as a function of distance
that can be compared to the measurements in data and/or simulation.
